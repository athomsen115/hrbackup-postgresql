Project
========

Over the course of the next few exercises, you’ll be creating a Python package to manage users on a server based on an “inventory” JSON file. The first step in this process is going to be setting up the project’s directory structure and metadata.

Usage
------

1. Create a project folder called hr (short for “human resources”).
2. Set up the directories to put the project’s source code and tests.
3. Create the setup.py with metadata and package discovery.
4. Utilize pipenv to create a virtualenv and Pipfile.
5. Add ``pytest`` and ``pytest-mock`` as development dependencies.
6. Set the project up in source control and make your initial commit.
